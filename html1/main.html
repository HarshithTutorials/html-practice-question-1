            <p class="matter-tea">Tea, with its rich history and cultural significance, holds a special place in the hearts and traditions of people worldwide. Legend has it that tea was discovered in China millennia ago when Emperor Shen Nong stumbled upon its aromatic infusion by chance. Since then, it has become not just a beverage but a symbol of hospitality, social interaction, and mindfulness. Across different cultures, tea ceremonies have evolved into revered rituals, from the elegant matcha ceremonies in Japan to the comforting afternoon teas of England.</p>
